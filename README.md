## Problem Statement

An individual's life is significantly impacted by the healthcare management system. It is true that healthcare management systems are becoming more widespread every day. The healthcare industry is influenced by a wide range of elements, including healthcare management solutions. Increasing public awareness of health legislation and healthcare management systems, as well as the need for top-notch medical facilities throughout the USA, are some of these answers. In a world that is continuously evolving, healthcare management is essential for staying competitive in the market and providing patients with improved treatment. Our proposal attempts to meet this demand for a centralized healthcare management system where a user may make vaccine requests and receive vaccinations, have routine physicals, schedule emergency medical care, look for and order medications, and go to a doctor's office.
